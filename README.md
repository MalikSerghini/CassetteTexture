# ThreeJS Project for GLTF Texture Creation

This is a small React project, created with Vite, designed to generate textures for GLTF objects from uploaded files (JPG, PNG, SVG). The project includes two GLTF models that I created using Blender. These models are available for free use under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

## Explanation

This project allows users to upload image files and apply them as textures to GLTF-Models.
The models used in this project are designed and created in Blender.
